This is an algorithm that computes the optimal splitting of a string into
palindromes of the smallest possible size. There are three solutions: 

1.) Written in python, runs in exponential time, cannot be used on strings 
    longer than ~10 because it runs in exp time. O(3^n) calls to isPalindrome

2.) This one is called palinSlow.hs. It can run on the first four strings in 
    reasonable time.

3.) The last solution relies on a divide and conquor algorithm. It can run all 
    the inputs in roughly 5 seconds. Oddly enough, the worst case is when the 
    string consists one repeated character. i. e. "aaaaaa.."


The last two functions are compiled and can be called from the command line.
1. The input file is read from input.txt
2. The program takes two arguments corresponding to the range of lines to use as input. 
    i.e. ./palin 2 4 would run the algorithm on lines 3-4 in input.txt.
